--SELECT * FROM employeeinfo

---- Today i will be practicing "ORDER BY & GROUP BY"
---- Fisrt i will try "DISTINCT"

--SELECT DISTINCT(Gender)
--FROM employeeinfo

---- Now I will go to "GROUP BY"
---- here GROUP BY applying on column Gender and this giving me two groups "male" & "female"
--SELECT Gender
--FROM employeeinfo
--GROUP BY Gender

---- here GROUP BY applying on column Age and this giving me 4 groups 20,21,22,23 respectively
--SELECT Age
--FROM employeeinfo
--GROUP BY Age

---- Using count in group by, that will give the number of objects in one group
--SELECT Age, count(age)
--FROM employeeinfo
--GROUP BY Age

----Now I am practicing "ORDER BY" 

----"ORDER BY Age"
--SELECT Age
--FROM employeeinfo
--GROUP BY Age
--ORDER BY Age

----"ORDER BY Gender" and using COUNT For counting
--SELECT Gender, COUNT(Gender)
--FROM employeeinfo
--GROUP BY Gender
--ORDER BY Gender

----giving condition of < & > & = in "GROUP BY" & "ORDER BY"

----for ">"
--SELECT Age, COUNT(Age)
--FROM employeeinfo
--WHERE Age > 20
--GROUP BY Age
--ORDER BY Age

----for "<"
--SELECT Age, COUNT(Age)
--FROM employeeinfo
--WHERE Age < 22
--GROUP BY Age
--ORDER BY Age

----this will give output in ascending order and also will give groups of different numbers
--SELECT Gender,Age, COUNT(Age)
--FROM employeeinfo
--GROUP BY Age,Gender
--ORDER BY Age,Gender
